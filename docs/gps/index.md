R package that processes GPS data collected on human behavior and merges time series with GGIR package for accelerometer data. The package provides a pipeline that performs the following:

- Loading GPS CSV files, with the aim of making this process flexible to most common formats. 
- Taking timezone into account when interpreting timestamps. 
- Calculating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GPS data. 
- Detecting and removing outliers in speed and elevation. 
- Calculating distance and speed. 
- Distinguishing between indoor and outdoor activities. 
- Detecting trips and allowing for breaks in between them. 
- Merging GGIR time series output data to work with various accelerometer brands and data formats. 
- Granting users control over crucial parameters.
